## Description
In this week I learned about Progressive Web Applications. This is called JATE, or Just Another Text Editor. I was given some starter code and had to build out the webpack and service worker. This was especially changenging trying to learn how to fix errors with a service worker. 

## Installation 
When you open the app in the root file run npm install to install all the dependencies.

## Usage
To use this app you can take notes in the text editor or you can install the app using the install button at the top of the screen. This will allow you to run the application while you are offline.
